git and github imp cmd lines


to create local repo
select the file location and type git init
git status ---> will give you which files are yet to be tracked
git add . -->  this means git add all
git commit -m "eg: my first commit"

if you delete any file from the folder then 
git commit -a -m "eg: modified/deleted"

if you are pushing your local repo to github for the first time then
github provides you the link you have to execute it

then, 
git branch -M main

git push -u origin main
 

extra:
to see what was the difference in two commits type git log

git clone (link here) --> clones the repository
